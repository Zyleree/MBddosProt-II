This is a Java-based proxy server with DDoS attack detection and mitigation capabilities. It forwards traffic to a main server while monitoring for potential DDoS attacks based on a rate-limiting mechanism. When an attack is detected, the server can take appropriate actions, such as blocking the offending IP or rate-limiting the traffic.
